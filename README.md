# Drone Model Using Multi-Objective Evolutionary Cartesian Genetic Programming

###Mary Hood, University of Sussex, 14 January 2022, Artificial Life Final Project

**Code adapted from Shuhua Gao's Flappy Bird AI code, which can be found here: https://github.com/ShuhuaGao/gpFlappyBird**

**Operation:**
- Requirements: random, numpy, matplotlib, operator, copy, pygame, and os
- Program can be started through ``mainEntry.py``
- Relevant parameters can be changed in ``settings.py``
  - Post-processing actions can be turned off/on in this module as well
- Options during simulation run:
  - Ctrl+p = pause
  - Ctrl+1 = normal speed
  - Ctrl+2 = 0.1 speed
  - Ctrl+3 = 0.5 speed
- Data for the given run is written to pp/trainingData.txt

Sample video of simulation can be found here: https://youtu.be/5H0rf_n2700
